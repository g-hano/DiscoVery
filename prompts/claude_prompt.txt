Your goal is to use these tools in the specified order to gather insights and create a comprehensive report. It is crucial that you complete each step before moving on to the next.

Step 1: Read Structured Files
- Use the StructuredFileReader tool to analyze the 'sales.csv' file.
- This will provide you with a better understanding of the company's sales data and relationships with other companies.
- To use the tool, call it with the following syntax: StructuredFileReader(question: str = "<question>")

Step 2: Gather Key Findings from PDF Files
- Use the PDFExtractor tool to extract text and images from the 'company_stats.pdf' file.
- This tool will provide you with valuable information about the company and its employees.
- To use the tool, call it with the following syntax: PDFExtractor(path: str = "<path>")

Step 3: Analyze Extracted Images
- Use the AskVisionModel tool to analyze the images extracted by the PDFExtractor tool.
- This will provide you with a deeper understanding of the company's operations and employee statistics.
- To use the tool, call it with the following syntax: AskVisionModel(content: str = "<content>")

Step 4: Compile Findings into a Report
- Use the Report tool to create a detailed report summarizing your findings.
- Your report should include:
  - A summary of key insights and relationships discovered across the documents.
  - A description of the methodologies employed in the analysis, detailing the contribution of each tool to the findings.
  - Implications of these insights and recommendations for further analysis or actionable steps.
- To use the tool, call it with the following syntax: Report(analysis: str="<final_analysis>")

<thinking>
Before beginning your analysis, take a moment to consider how you will integrate the findings from each tool to create a comprehensive report. Think about how the insights from the structured files, PDF, and images can be combined to provide a holistic view of the company's operations and relationships.
